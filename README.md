Output the total viewership for laptop and mobile devices in the format of "laptop_views" and "mobile_views".
```sql
SELECT 
  SUM(CASE WHEN device_type = ('laptop') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS laptop_views,
  SUM(CASE WHEN device_type IN ('tablet', 'phone') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS mobile_views
FROM viewership
```

#### ‚úîÔ∏è Average Review Ratings | Amazon <br>
Given the reviews table, write a query to get the average stars for each product every month.
The output should include the month in numerical value, product id, and average star rating rounded to two decimal places. Sort the output based on month followed by the product id.
```sql
SELECT 
  extract(month from submit_date) AS mth,
  product_id AS product,
  ROUND(AVG(stars),2) AS avg_stars
FROM reviews
GROUP BY extract(month from submit_date), product
ORDER BY mth, product
```

#### ‚úîÔ∏è Cities With Completed Trades | Robinhood <br>
Given the tables containing information on Robinhood trades and users. Write a query to list the top three cities that have the most completed trade orders in descending order.
```sql
SELECT city, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'Completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_orders
FROM trades JOIN users
ON trades.user_id = users.user_id
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY total_orders DESC
LIMIT 3
```

#### ‚úîÔ∏è Sending vs. Opening Snaps | Snapchat <br>
Given the tables containing information on Snapchat users, their ages, and their time spent sending and opening snaps. Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps (as a percentage of total time spent on these activities) for each age group.

Output the age bucket and percentage of sending and opening snaps. Round the percentage to 2 decimal places.
```sql
WITH open AS(
  SELECT age_bucket, SUM(time_spent) AS open_time
  FROM activities act JOIN age_breakdown
  ON act.user_id = age_breakdown.user_id
  WHERE activity_type = 'open'
  GROUP BY age_bucket),
send AS(
  SELECT age_bucket, SUM(time_spent) AS send_time
  FROM activities act JOIN age_breakdown
  ON act.user_id = age_breakdown.user_id
  WHERE activity_type = 'send'
  GROUP BY age_bucket)

SELECT open.age_bucket, 
  ROUND((open_time/(send_time+open_time))*100.0,2) AS open_perc, 
  ROUND((send_time/(send_time+open_time))*100.0,2) AS send_perc
FROM open JOIN send
ON open.age_bucket = send.age_bucket
```
